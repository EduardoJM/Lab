<h1>About</h1>

<p>Hello! This is my Programming Laboratory! But, first, the most important thing is: who am i? I'm <a href="https://github.com/eduardoJM" target="_blank">Eduardo Oliveira</a>, a brazilian Math and Developer with a special love in understand how the things works. You can see a little bit more about me in my GitHub: <a href="https://github.com/eduardoJM" target="_blank">@EduardoJM</a> and, in portuguese, in my <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/edujso/" target="_blank">LinkedIn</a>.</p>

<h3>What is this project?</h3>

<p>This is a GitHub repository with various of my little projects, that i not consider sufficiently important to get a complete repository, and testing stuff. When i decided to create this repository with various of those things, i decided to create a little website using the GitHub pages to write some text about the things i study. Some of my texts are, too, in Medium, and i add in the futher one section here to my texts.</p>
